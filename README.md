## Description

This project is a solution provided by Team ZETA in the FINNOVATE'24 Fintech Hackathon organized by IIEC, IIT Gandhinagar. Our aim is to deliver financial literacy to various target groups, including underserved and unserved populations, women, youngsters, students, and more. We offer a platform where individuals can learn about financial literacy, financial planning, investment, savings, and related topics.

Each topic includes well-structured modules and quizzes to test the user's knowledge. Additionally, we provide a chat platform where users can ask queries and receive answers from a specifically trained LLM.

To enhance the learning experience, we have gamified the platform with simulations, allowing users to practice real-world scenarios and learn from them.

We Have also added a discussion forum where users can ask questions and get answers from other users.

Moreover, a calling feature is available where users can call the LLM to ask finance-related queries. Our bot will respond in a very human-like voice, providing answers to their questions.
